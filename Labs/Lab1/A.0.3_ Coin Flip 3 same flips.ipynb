    "Create a program that uses Pythonâ€™s random number generator to simulate flipping a coin several times. The simulated coin should be fair, meaning that the probability of heads is equal to the probability of tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the program is run, your program should flip simulated coins until either 3 consecutive heads or 3 consecutive tails occur. \n",
    "Display an H each time the outcome is heads, and a T each time the outcome is tails, with all of the outcomes shown on the same line. Then display the number of flips needed to reach 3 consecutive flips with the same outcome.  \n",
