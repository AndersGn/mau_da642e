Day-old bread is discounted by 60 percent. Write a program that begins by reading the number of loaves of day-old bread being purchased from the user. Then your program should display the regular price for the bread, the discount because it is a day old, and the total price. All of the values should be displayed using two decimal places, and the decimal points in all of the numbers should be aligned when reasonable values are entered by the user.\n","\n","# Author: Anders Grahn\n","# Date: 2024-01-19\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"aOZvT902P6pz"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["How many day old breads do you want to buy: 2\n","Regular price:\t$6.98\n","Your discount:\t$4.19\n","Total:\t\t$2.79\n"]}],"source":["print(\"How many day old breads do you want to buy: \", end =\"\")\n","user_input_number_of_day_old_breads = int(input())\n","print(user_input_number_of_day_old_breads)\n","number_of_bred = user_input_number_of_day_old_breads\n","discount_day_old_bread = 0.6 #Convert the percentage discount to a decimal.\n","ordinary_price = 3.49\n","\n","sum_without_discount = ordinary_price * user_input_number_of_day_old_breads\n","sum_total_discount = discount_day_old_bread * sum_without_discount\n","sum_with_discount = sum_without_discount - sum_total_discount\n","\n","print('Regular price:\\t${0}'.format(round(sum_without_discount,2)))\n","print(\"Your discount:\\t${0}\".format(round(sum_total_discount,2)))\n","print(\"Total:\\t\\t${0}\".format(round(sum_with_discount,2)))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyNNxBeul0kA9uRdMP4//tAb","gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
