However, this simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two years. As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog years.\n","Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years described in the previous paragraph. Ensure that your program works correctly for conversions of less than two human years and for conversions of two or more human years. Your program should display an appropriate error message if the user enters a negative number.\n","\n","# Author: Anders Grahn\n","# Date: 2024-01-19"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2827,"status":"ok","timestamp":1705775968229,"user":{"displayName":"Anders G","userId":"14498596150220147654"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Qj5SqVYMAZkp","outputId":"a797cc8b-5a3b-4ff2-f52e-d937efbdf191"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["How many human years do you want to convert into dog years: 12.0\n","Your dog is 61.0 dog years old\n"]}],"source":["from dog_years import calculate_dog_years\n","\n","# Read the user input\n","print(\"How many human years do you want to convert into dog years: \", end =\"\")\n","user_input_human_years = float(input())\n","print(user_input_human_years)\n","\n","# Make sure the user enter a positive number\n","if user_input_human_years > 0:\n","  # Show the result to the user\n","  print(\"Your dog is {dog_years} dog years old\".format(dog_years=calculate_dog_years(user_input_human_years)))\n","else:\n","  print(\"Ooops, You have to enter a number greater than 0\")"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyN+8tDArJVwPx8HCmp9FEDz","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
